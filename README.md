# SpaceX Landing Page

This is a test assignment for the Sagirov.com company for the position of frontend developer.

Made on React.js

The web app has adaptive styles, so you can watch it on tablets & smartphones.

I also set up an automatic deployment on Ubuntu server using Github Actions. See the server.yml for more info.

Install dependencies:

`cd <your-directory>/sagirov-tw-react`

`npm install`

Run project locally:
`npm start`
